# ======================================================================================================== #

# This script is for analyzing current policy settings and reform options for the tax treatment of super earnings. We gather super balances, incomes etc. from the SIH 11-12 person-level dataset, inflate everything forward to 2015-16, and use these to project super earnings on those balances. We then apply current policy setting for super earnings, generate benchmark tax treatments where: (a) all taxpayers pay 15% tax on super earnings regardless of age; and (b) super earnings are incorporated into taxable income and taxed at personal marginal tax rates (this is how Treasury's tax expenditures are done). We then consider the various reform options, generate costings and charts that are used in the super chapter of the Budget Repair report

# However, as always more can be done to refine this analysis. The below to do list reports various refinements and whether they have been done.

# NEXT STEPS - 

# (1) We should inflate all our variables forward to 2015-16, including super balances- DONE for inflation, but we could grow income forward by nominal wages (eg. use the ABS wage price index for this)
# (2) Check our estimate for super earnings - standard benchmark used in Treasury and the OECD appears to be 7 per cent after fees (but before tax)
# (3) Adjust tax rates for super earnings to account for (a) 10% CGT for super; and (b) dividend imputation. Estimates from Mercer suggest an effective tax rate of around 8-9 per cent is reasonable
# (4) Generate a more nuanced taxable income variable (i.e. better than SIH total income) to use when estimating value of super earnings tax concession against personal income tax benchmark
# (5) Should we be substracting any super income streams from our total income (including super earnings)? If we're including super earnings in income, then we shouldnt be including drawdowns on super as income at the same time to avoid double counting
# (6) Better define those in the drawdown phase as those aged over 60 drawing an income stream from a super fund - DONE 
# (7) Introducing a different earnings rate in the accumulation and drawdown phases - DONE
# (8) Introducing a different effective tax rate on earnings between the accumulation and drawdown phases - DONE
# (9) Write in Medicare Levy function, differentiated by Age (DONE) and family status (DONE)
# (10) Write in SAPTO for singles and couples (DONE) and allow SAPTO entitlements to be transferred among couples (NOT DONE)
# (11) Write in LITO function (DONE)
# (12) Account for behavioural change as retirees shift funds out of super to minimise tax by making the most of their TF threshold, SAPTO and LITO entitlements (DONE)
# (12) Better map ABS total incomes to ATO taxable incomes. One approach would be to estimate our estimated tax on individuals, and compare this to the ABS' imputed estimated. If all else fails we might have to use HILDA instead if the data there is more reliable / detailed, especially on the tax estimates.

# We've also assumed that all withdrawals from super (pension or lump sum) are not included in estimates of total income. This isa comprehensive income tax base so withdrawals are not included - same as withdrawing $$$ from a bank account isnt counted as income

# Some basic calculations to adjust for inflation 

# We want to cost this for the 2015-16 budget 
# For now I'll just inflate at the inflation rate - in the future it may be better to inflate  variables by 10 year averages of inflation and wages, depending on the variable

# We dont inflate super balances at this stage since we adjust them separately below. This is because (a) balances compound over time at a rate faster than inflation - ore $$$ are being added to the system each year in contributions and investment earnings, than are being taken out via drawdowns; and (b) the survey data is likely to underreport aggregate super balances 

# Assume 2.5 per cent inflation rate

# Prices are now in 2015-16 terms since that's the budget we're looking at
years = 4

#===================================================================================
# Grow forward super account balances


# We have total super balances, before inflating, of $1.14 trillion

sum(person.dfkvi$Total.super * person.dfkvi$Weights) / 10^9

sum(person.dfkvi$Gov.super * person.dfkvi$Weights) / 10^9 # $300 billion
sum(person.dfkvi$Non.gov.super * person.dfkvi$Weights) / 10^9 # $840 billion

# By comparison, APRA reports total funds under management of $2 trillion as of end June 2015
# http://www.apra.gov.au/Super/Publications/Documents/1508-QSP-June2015.pdf

# So we inflate forward our super account balances by a factor of 2/1.14. This way our weighted survey sample has total account balances equal to the aggregate account balances nationally, and we assume that the distribution of super balances across our survey sample holds across the whole population 

# Let x be our growth factor
x <- 2/1.14

# Inflating super balances by x
person.dfkvi$Gov.super <- person.dfkvi$Gov.super * x

# Estimate super earnings        
# ======================================================================================================== #

# Set super rate of return

# The rate of return on super account balances will vary between the accumulation and drawdown phases. Retirees in the drawdown phase tend to be more conservative in their investment decisions, with a greater weighting towards safer, lower yielding assets such as bank deposits

# The 10-year average post-tax return for all super funds in the APRA Superannuation Bulletin is 6 per cent. This figure is net of fees and taxes on earnings, and therefore also includes any franking credits on investments in Australian equities or trusts. (http://www.apra.gov.au/Super/Publications/Documents/Revised%202013%20Annual%20Superannuation%20Bulletin%2005-02-14.pdf)

# With an effective tax rate on super earnings bounded by the tax rate on capital gains (10%) and the tax rate on other investment income for the super fund (15%), it's reasonable to suggest a pre-tax rate of return on super fund assets of 7% in the accumulation phase 

# In the drawdown phase we use a pre-tax rate of return of 5%. The 5% return in the drawdown phase comes from PBO advice to Senator David L on a similar costing that has been published onthr DLP's facebook page (no kidding...) - https://www.facebook.com/LDP.australia/posts/10152975190247672

Super.return.rate.acc <- 0.07 # 7 per cent return in the accumulation phase
Super.return.rate.ddown <- 0.05 # 5 per cent return in the drawdown phase

# So super earnings will depend upon whether super account holders are in the accumulation or drawdown phases

# person.dfkvi$Super.earnings <- ifelse(person.dfkvi$Super.ddown == 1, Super.return.rate.ddown*person.dfkvi$Total.super, Super.return.rate.acc*person.dfkvi$Total.super)

# 
# # Funds reported investment earnings of $137 billion in 2013-14, and $117 billion in 2014-15. So our numbers probably stack up okay.



# person.dfkvi$Total.income.annual.s <- person.dfkvi$Total.income.annual + person.dfkvi$Super.earnings
# person.dfkvi$Taxable.income.annual.s <- person.dfkvi$Taxable.income.annual + person.dfkvi$Super.earnings

# =======================================================================================================
# Effective tax rate on super earnings 
# ======================================================================================================#

# Here we apply an effective tax rate on super earnings, where those earnings are net of fees. Since franking credits are included in super fund income, these franking credits are taxed in the fund. Therefore the effective tax rate on super earnings should be bounded by the tax rate on capital gains (10%) and the tax rate on other investment income for the super fund (15%).

# For now, we assume a 50:50 split in super fund earnings between capital gains and other investment earnings. This leads to an effective tax rate on super earnings of 12.5%. We will structure the analysis to allow different effective tax rates on super earnings between the accumulation and drawdown phases, as those in the drawdown phase tend to invest in less risky, income earning assets with fewer or no capital gains (i.e. bank deposits)

# Set assumed tax rate - we use 8% currently but depends on the answers to the above

tax.rate.ddown <- 0.14 # For the drawdown phase

# ==================================================================================
# Modelling reform options - with behavioural change
# =================================================================================#

# Now we take a look at the reform options accounying for behavioural change with respect to whether ppl choose to withdraw their super savings to make use of Tax free thresholds outside of the super system.

# In this section we consider 3 reform options:

# (a) Reintroduce a 15% tax rate on super for over 60s (Grattan Proposal)
# (b) Reintroduce a 15% tax rate on super for over 60s - with an $18200 tax free threshold
# (c) Apply a 30% super earning tax rate for under 60s - with a $75000 tax free threshold (ALP policy)

# ==================================================================================
# (a) Reintroduce a 15% tax rate on super for over 60s

# We already have our estimates of the value of the savings from the three reform options assuming no behaviour change.

# However, those in the drawdown phase that now face tax on super earnings from the first $ have a strong incentive to withdraw funds from super in order to make the most of the tax free threshold that exists outside of super. We assume that individuals respond to the tax change by minimising their tax by withdrawing super earnings up to the point that they maximise their tax-free threshold and LITO and SAPTO entitlements outside of super. 

# So we write in our behavioural change - ppl affected withdraw what super earnings they can from super to make use of TF thresholds outside of super

# We need to write a function that accounts for the tax-free threshold, plus an SAPTO and LITO entitlement WHEN they are actually unused since they taper away.

Households may under report their incomes in the survey at all income levels, including low income households. However, households can correctly report low levels of income if they incur losses in their unincorporated business or have negative returns from their other investments.

# When creating equivalised income deciles the ABS converts negative disposable incomes to zero

# http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6523.0Explanatory%20Notes12011-12?OpenDocument

# Therefore we first re-write total income such that it cant be negative for each of our three income variables:

# Total annual income, excluding super fund earnings
# Total annual income, including super fund earnings
# Total annual income, including super withdrawals in income, but including super earnings (to avoid double counting)
