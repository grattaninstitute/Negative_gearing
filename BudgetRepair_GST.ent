The
result
is
that
households
are
under-taxed
because
there
is
no
tax
on
the
value-added
component
of
financial
services
and
businesses
are
over-taxed
because
they
cannot
claim
GST
offsets
for
the
embedded
taxes
they
pay
on
these

Ultimately,
the
goal
should
be
to
tax
financial
services
in
the
same
way
as
other
consumption
to
remove
this
distortion.
