\title{A higher or broader GST}

\begin{summary}
Since its introduction in 2000, proposals to extend or broaden Australia's 10 per cent goods and services tax (GST) have been a perennial in the tax reform debate in Australia. Given the Commonwealth Government's revenue problems and the looming challenges for state governments in funding growing healthcare costs, it is unsurprising people are once again looking to the GST as a way to boost government revenues. 

Raising more money through raising the GST or applying it to more things is preferable to most of the other revenue-raising alternatives. A broad based tax on consumption is one of the least damaging taxes to economic growth. Broadening the coverage of the tax would reduce distortions and compliance costs compared to its current narrow coverage. But increasing the rate of the GST is a satisfactory second best if broadening the base is politically too hard.

\textbf{Extending the GST} to cover many of the categories currently exempt could raise almost \textbf{\$20~billion} per year. While \textbf{increasing the rate to 15 per cent} would generate around \textbf{\$27~billion}. 

The regressive impacts of a broader or higher GST can be mitigated by higher welfare payments. Spending around 30 per cent of the increase in revenue on higher welfare payments would leave most of the bottom 20 per cent of income earners better off. And increases in welfare payments can be structured so for most recipients there is no change in their incentive to work. 

The major concern with this approach is that compensating welfare payments may be eroded over time. Overcompensation of the most vulnerable recipients should help ease this concern: a substantial boost to payments, even if eroded over time, could leave many recipients better off than otherwise for many years.

Modest income tax cuts should also be part of any GST reform package. Income tax cuts provide compensation further up the income distribution, while also paying an economic dividend.  Appropriately targeted tax cuts will maintain and even increase work incentives for low to middle income taxpayers most responsive to changes in the effective tax rates.   

But if the GST is to provide higher revenues to help the states fund their hospital spending, then not everyone can be fully compensated. Channelling 30 per cent of additional revenues from a broader or higher GST to tax cuts will allow the government to shave at least two percentage points off the bottom two tax rates. Tax cuts of this magnitude fully compensate most low and middle income households -- those earning up to \$100,000 a year -- for the increase in GST. 

Beyond their immediate hip pocket, most Australians benefit from better government services that increased GST collections could fund. The 40 per cent of the revenue left over after tax cuts and welfare payments should go to State governments to help them address their looming hospital funding gap so they can continue to supply the new and better treatments that the public demands.

\chapter{Australia should raise more from the GST}\label{chap:Chapter1}
\section{GST in context}
The GST is a 10 per cent consumption tax levied on final consumption of all goods and services other than fresh food, health, education, water, childcare, financial services, rent and a few other smaller expenditure categories. 

GST revenues are collected by the Commonwealth Government and are then distributed to State Governments as untied grants. The GST is distributed according to determinations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which tries to ensure that States have resources to provide services at them same standard as each other.\footcite[p.~12]{CommonwealthGrantsCommission2015}

The GST raised \$54~billion in 2014-15.\footcite[p.~4-16]{Budget2015} This was around 12~per cent of government revenus in Australia -- well below the average of 20~per cent for all OECD countries.\footnote{The OECD average was 19.5 per cent in 2012 (See: \textcite{OECD2014})} \dots\ Indeed, Australia relies less on broad-based consumption tax to raise revenue than all but two OECD countries.\footnote{The exceptions are Japan and the United States (which does not have a broad-based consumption tax) \textcite[p~40]{OECD2014} }  Australia's GST only covers about 47 per cent of consumption, below the OECD average of 55 per cent, and well below New Zealand where the GST covers 96 per cent of all goods and services consumed.\footnote{\textcite[p.~95]{OECD2014} . The OECD calculates its consumption tax coverage ratio based on the difference between consumption tax revenue actually collected and what would be theoretically raised if consumption tax were applied at the standard rate to the potential tax base in a `pure' consumption tax regime.} 

Not only are Australia's revenues from broad-based consumption taxes low by international standards, they are shrinking relative to the economy. In the decade to 2014-15, GST revenues fell from almost 4.0 to 3.4 per cent of GDP.  Households saved more of their incomes (\Vref{fig:Households_are_saving_more}), and spent more of their incomes on GST-exempt items, particularly housing (\Vref{fig:Spending_less_on_GST_liable}).

There is no obvious reason for these trends to reverse in the foreseeable future. Savings rates are now close to long-run averages with low savings rates in the early 1990s and 2000s looking like a historical anomaly (\Vref{fig:Households_are_saving_more}). The proportion of incomes spent on health is forecast continue to grow.  And the proportion of incomes spent on housing may well also continue to increase, as land supply is finite, and new housing supply is struggling to meet the demands of a growing population. \footnote{Ultimately the path of prices will depend on population growth, household size and whether supply of new properties keeps pace with the growth in demand. \textcite[p.~7]{RBA2014}} The GST has not been, and may never entirely be the "growth" tax the states were originally promised.\footcite{Costello2000}

\section{Why consumption taxes are less bad than many other taxes}
Consumption taxes such as the GST are relatively efficient taxes. They are relatively difficult to avoid,\footcite[p.~274]{Treasury2010}  and they encourage saving more than personal income taxes.\footnote{A consumption tax treats current and future consumption equivalently so there is no distortion in savings decisions. In contrast, income tax places a higher burden on savers because households pay tax on their income (regardless of how much they save) and then taxes the capital income on savings again in the future. See: \textcite{Treasury2010} However, the tax rate on savings makes relatively little difference to savings decisions of high income earners who do most of the saving: see \textcite{DaleySuperannuation2015}}  They drag less on economic efficiency than many state government taxes including payroll taxes\footnote{While theoretically broad based payroll taxes and consumption taxes are equivalent, the range of exceptions and thresholds provided by state government for payroll taxes have considerably increased their efficiency costs.}  and stamp duties.\footcite{DaleyProperty2015} 

An increase in consumption tax in effect acts as part a lump sum tax on accumulated wealth, and so collects more from households such as retirees that are living from savings and income from investments. Such households otherwise contribute less to tax collections, and their contribution relative to younger households is falling as a result of age-based tax-free thresholds, and superannuation tax breaks.\footcite{Daley2014}  Our Wealth of Generations report showed that households over 55 pay much less tax on average than younger households, despite much higher wealth.\footcite[p.~27]{Daley2014}  

Consumption taxes can affect incentives to work less than income taxes. The combination of income tax scales and the withdrawal of means tested welfare benefits can discourage working because they result in low rates of take home pay. The disincentives are larger for low income workers and those working part time Box 1).\footnote{\textcites{Commission2015}{Harding2009}{ReferenceGroupToMinisterForSocialServices2015} which recommended mechanisms to improve these incentives.}  Higher income tax rates as a result of bracket creep can materially reduce workforce participation of middle income part-time earners.\footcite[p.~6]{Daley2015} 

Consumption taxes do discourage work to some extent, because wages buy less once the consumption tax is taken into account.\footcite{PicosSanchez2011}  However, consumption taxes may discourage working less than income taxes because their impact on spending power is less obvious. Consumption taxes are less salient: there is some experimental economics evidence that people notice nominal wages (due to income tax) more than lower real wages (due to a consumption tax).\footnote{\textcites{Blumkin2012}{SausgruberTyran2005}  This is because of the `money illusion': individuals tend to think in nominal rather than real terms.} 

Overall, higher consumption taxes should cause fewer problems than higher income taxes. Overall incentives to work can be improved if income tax cuts introduced with the GST are targeted at low and middle brackets (Box 1). 

And potential disincentives to work from higher welfare benefits to compensate poorer households for a higher GST can be managed by the design of these measures (section 3). 

\begin{smallbox}{Impact of taxes on labour supply}{box:labour_supply}
There is a comprehensive literature on the effect of taxes on labour supply decisions. In \textcite{Mirrlees2011}, \textcite{meghir2008labour} provide a summary of this work and nominate the findings for which there is consensus or near consensus. 

Almost all the relevant studies find that men's hours of work are relatively unresponsive to tax changes. This is because most men work full-time. But for men with low levels of education, the decision of whether to work is somewhat affected by tax and welfare incentives. For highly educated men, tax rates make almost no difference to their work decisions. However, tax rates do affect their taxable incomes: high income taxpayers are more likely to convert income into non-taxable forms when tax rates are high.  

On the other hand, empirical studies invariably find that tax and welfare benefits have a much greater bearing on working decisions for women with young children, particularly single mothers -- affecting both the decision to work and the number of hours chosen.  

Taken together, the studies suggests that the people whose labour supply decisions are most responsive to changes are those on low and middle incomes deciding whether to work or whether to increase their hours of work. If one objective of tax reform is to increase workforce participation, then tax cuts should focus on the low to middle brackets.

\end{smallbox}
\chapter{A broader base, or a higher rate?}
GST revenue collections can be increased either by broadening the range of items that are subject to the tax (`broadening the base') or by increasing the rate above the current 10 per cent. Broadening the base is generally favoured on pure policy grounds because it is simpler and more efficient. But increasing the rate could be a satisfactory `second best'; if it is too politically difficult to broaden the base. 

\section{Broadening the GST}
Australia's GST covers just over 40 per cent of the potential consumption base. This is well below the OECD average of 55~per~cent (\Cref{chap:Chapter1}).

There are a range of expenditure categories currently exempt from the GST. Broadening the base to include fresh food, education, health, water and sewerage could raise almost \$20 billion (Figure 3).This figure takes into account the effects of changes in consumer behaviour due to the increased prices in these categories.

This would leave exemptions in place for financial services, existing residential housing, and some other smaller spending categories.\footnote{These include supplies by charitable organisations and administrative exemptions, from example for very small businesses. \textcite{Treasury2014}}  These are currently `input taxed'. Financial service providers pay GST on their inputs but do not charge GST to customers.\footnote{\textcite[p.~169]{Treasury2014}  The result is that households are under-taxed because there is no tax on the value-added component of financial services and businesses are over-taxed because they cannot claim GST offsets for the embedded taxes they pay on these services. Ultimately, the goal should be to tax financial services in the same way as other consumption to remove this distortion. Freebairn (2013); Treasury (2010), p. 52.} Similarly, home owners pay GST on the costs of maintaining and upgrading their house but there is no GST levied on the `imputed rents'. GST is not applied on rents for investment properties to maintain neutrality between owner occupiers and investors. 

Taxing the full value added by these services would be complex. It is not easy to determine the appropriate margin on which to calculate the tax. For these reasons, these categories are excluded from value added tax in almost every OECD country.\footcite[p.~21]{OECD2014}

The Government has already announced proposed changes to the GST treatment of imports from 1 July 2017. Imports worth less than \$1000 are currently exempt from the GST. Under the new policies, GST will apply to all imported digital goods and services and physical goods.\footnote{In other words, the value threshold is set at zero. The measure to include GST on cross-border supplies of digital goods and services was included in the May 2015 Budget \textcite[p.~20]{Budget2015}. The Government announced a policy to charge GST on cross-border supplies of physical goods under \$1000 following agreement with the State and Territory treasurers at a meeting in August 2015. \textcite{Hockey2015}.}  The requirement to collect and remit GST will be imposed on the overseas vendor. As for domestically produced goods and services, only vendors with an Australian turnover of \$75,000 will need to register for and charge the GST. 

The policy imposes a fixed cost on overseas retailers selling to Australians, as they would need to implement systems that apply specifically to any purchaser based in Australia. This impost would be relatively small for retailers that sell large volumes to Australians, like Amazon and Netflix. Some of these have already suggested they will register for the GST.\footnote{Netflix indicated they will continue to comply with local tax obligations. Apple already charges GST on its digital downloads in Australia. \url{http://www.afr.com/technology/web/joe-hockey-flags-netflix-tax-in-gst-extension-20150409-1mhhed}} However, it is not clear the legal recourse available to the government if overseas vendors do not choose to register.\footnote{The Low-Value Parcel Processing Taskforce that explored this issue in 2012 said that GST obligations imposed directly on international suppliers would ``likely be non-enforceable, and hence rely on voluntary cooperation by suppliers'' (Treasury (2012b), p. 139).} The former Treasurer Joe Hockey argued that ``global pressure'' would force retailers to comply. 

Any system that requires Customs to verify GST compliance and charge consumers where the supplier is non-compliant will be expensive to administer. Previous reviews found inspecting packages at the border costs much more money than it raises in additional tax, particularly for low values of the threshold.  This is because most imports below the current \$1,000 threshold are low value items. Credit-card transaction data suggests that 90 per cent of imports of less than \$1000 cost less than \$100 and 49 per cent cost less than~\$10.\footcite[p.~1]{NAB2013}  

\subsection{Broadening the GST will make it simpler and more efficient}
A broader base for consumption taxes minimise distortions in decision making. By taxing purchases of all goods and services at the same rate, people consume whichever goods and services that provide them with the most value. When differential tax rates apply then there are welfare losses; people are induced to consume relatively more of the lower taxed goods and less of the higher taxed goods than they would otherwise prefer.\footcite{AtkinsonStiglitz1976}

There are other reasons to favour a broad based tax. Exemptions create administrative costs for business that deal with both exempt and non-exempt goods. And grey lines create opportunities for tax avoidance and lobbying to exclude particular goods.\footnote{A recent poll of the 49 senior economists on the National Economic Panel found that more than half favoured broadening the base of the GST over than increasing the rate. Most were in favour of the efficiency and simplicity gains from this approach. In contrast, the one third that disagreed (the balance were undecided) were either sceptical about the net efficiency gains and/or doubts that compensation would be adequate to address the effects of a more comprehensive GST for those on low incomes.}

\subsection{Social purposes of existing exemptions could be served better by other means}

Some defend the existing exemptions because they send consumers worthwhile price signals to consume more healthy fresh food and to spend more on private health and education in ways that reduce the pressures on the public systems. 

However, GST exemptions are an inefficient way to pursue these ends. There are any number of goods and services the government might want to promote or deter. But the tax system is a blunt instrument for fine-tuning consumption habits. There are few items with market failures so large that they justify governments imposing differential tax treatment despite the efficiency costs.\footcite{Mirlees2011}  For these items, government can design `sin taxes' specifically aimed at the problems.\footnote{  In these examples the purpose of the taxes is to change relative prices and therefore behaviour rather than to simply raise money.}
For example, if governments want to use taxes to encourage better diet, then a high tax rate targeted at foods high in sugar and salt would be much more effective than a relatively small shift in the price of all processed food.\footnote{For example, the Australian Government's \textcite[p.~15]{PreventativeHealthTaskforce2008} recommend a review of taxation consider increasing taxes on energy dense foods.}
In any case, empirical evidence indicates that there would be relatively little change in consumer behaviour if government broadened the GST to include fresh food \Vref{box:ChangeInConsumerChoices}.

Others argue that a GST on private health and education services will give public providers an advantage over private providers. But governments don't aim for a level playing field in health and education: they explicitly provide higher subsidies for those using the public systems. 

A more serious objection is that charging GST on private health and education could reduce total government revenue if it led people to switch from less subsidised private services to more subsidised government services. But the evidence suggests that switching would be limited (Box 1). Further for schools, it is now less clear that the government subsidy provided to private schools is substantially less than the subsidy for public schools once the relative disadvantage of the student base is taken into account.\footnote{A unpublished study using using MySchool data to adjust for relative disadvantage suggests that Catholic private schools receive only slightly less (and in some cases more) government funding per student for a given range of student disadvantage. Other independent schools receive somewhat less but the gap is decreasing over time. \textcite{Bonner2015}} 

\begin{bigbox*}{Change in consumer choices due to a broader GST}{box:ChangeInConsumerChoices}
Broadening the GST will increase the relative price of fresh food and private health and education services. But empirical evidence suggests that behavioural changes could be modest. 
Treasury finds that demand in the fresh food category is inelastic, so that a price rise will not lead to much change in consumption. It estimates that a 10 per cent increased tax on food would only reduce consumption by 1.6 per cent (Treasury (2014)). 

A study by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation using data from the ABS Household Expenditure Survey also concluded that demand for fresh foods such as milk, bread and fresh vegetables are relatively unresponsive to relative price changes. The estimates suggest that a 10 per cent increase in price for a particularly item would reduce consumption by between 2 and 7 per cent. For fresh fruit, consumption is estimated to fall proportionately with the price rise (Ulubasoglu et al. (2011)). Because these estimates look at changes in demand from price rises for particular food categories in isolation, they will overstate the degree of substitution from an across the board increase in fresh food prices.

Studies of private health insurance in Australia and internationally have found that consumers are not very responsive to price changes. Estimates of the price elasticity of supplementary private health insurance (insurance that provides more choice or faster access relative to universal health care) range from $-0.2$ and $-0.5$, suggesting that demand would fall less than 5 per cent in response to a 10 per cent GST (Cheng (2013)). Another study calculates that the price elasticity of health insurance in Australia would need to be $-1.43$ for rebates to be self-financing, suggesting that switching to the public sector will not come close to eliminating revenue gains (Frech and Hopkins (2004)). This is perhaps unsurprising given policies like lifetime health cover loading and the Medicare levy surcharge provide a strong incentive for those above 30 and/or on higher incomes to maintain cover (ATO (2015)).

Treasury estimates that demand for medical and health services may only fall as little as 1.5 per cent in response to a 10 per cent GST. However, the government may face pressure to decrease co-payments for some health services if price increases disproportionately impact on disadvantaged groups. This would somewhat offset potential revenue gains from applying the GST to these services. 

Treasury's elasticity estimate for private education services is close to one but this includes the effects of reductions in demand for discretionary courses for which students are less likely to switch to public providers. Historical trends in Australian private school enrolments suggest that parents are not particularly price sensitive. Between 1990 and 2007, average fees roughly doubled in real terms for both Catholic and Independent schools. During this period their enrolment share increased by around two and five percentage points respectively (Nous Group (2011)). 


\end{bigbox*}

\section{Increasing the GST rate}
An alternative to broadening the base of the GST is to increase the rate. Australia's 10 per cent rate is low by international standards. It is the fourth lowest value added tax rate in the OECD, and considerably below the OECD average of 19 per cent.

Increasing the rate of the tax from 10 to 15 per cent could raise as much as \$27 billion. This does not factor in behavioural change, although revenue leakage from substitution to exempt categories is likely to be limited.  As discussed above, consumption of GST exempt categories (particularly fresh food, health and education) is not affected much by their price relative to other goods and services.

For the efficiency and simplicity reasons discussed above broadening the base would be better than raising the rate.
