# Negative_gearing
Analysis of negative gearing and CGT

Hi Jim! 

Thanks very much for this QC. The file `CGT_and_neg_gearing_parent.Rnw` is a subsection of the report. 

You will need to `devtools::install_github("hughparsonage/grattan")` and `devtools::install_github("hughparsonage/taxstats")`.

Things to QC:

* The costings: are the printed numbers correct?
* Charts and tables (but not effective marginal tax rates): do they present accurately the underlying data?

If it doesn't compile, let me know immediately.
